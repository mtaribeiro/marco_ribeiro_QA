Instructions:

Mac execution
- Install webdriver.io following the instruction from https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html
- open a new terminal window and  pull the code on github ( ) . To avoid mistakes, I upload all code.
- open a terminal window and type./geckodriver --port 4444 -> will run the geckodriver . DON'T CLOSE THIS WINDOW
- open a new terminal window and  pull the code on github ( )
- the code source is available at ./test/specs folder
- to run go to main folder and type ./node_modules/.bin/wdio wdio.conf.js , then it will run the code from specs folder automatically on Firefox browser



Initially, I have considered only open source solutions.
There are several frameworks available in the market for several programming languages.

To select the ideal framework we have to consider the experience of the team in programming languages javascript and python. Any other option other than this will be time consuming in order to learn and the tests will take longer to develop. In addition, the code will not be known by all, due to limited knowledge of the language.
So the first option is Selenium, which can be programmed in both Python and Javascript as well as being a language widely used in the market and of excellent reputation. The second one would be Webdriver.io (javascript) which has been developed in these tests.


Both options are available for Mac, Windows and linux OS and can be executed for many browsers.


If you have questions, let me know.
